This is a .exe file (created using python) that , when run with administration permissions , will blankout the device screen and no keyboard or mouse will work. you have to enter "x" char to terminate the file . In case if the "x" char is not working then try to force shutDown the laptop by long pressing the power button. Version 1 is only compatible for windows. For your safety DONT TRY on alter os.
